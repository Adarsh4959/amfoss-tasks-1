# Introspection

### Why must we choose you?
I honestly love coding. Getting an idea and implementing it to action is probably the best form of satisfaction as far as I am concerned. Since the club has a lot of multifaceted people, I could help myself in learning and improving my knowledge. There are a lot of "off" things about me which I could probably overcome if I join amFOSS. I'm socially super awkward. Spending time with different people might help, I am super lazy and postpone important things without any reason, I am not physically active.. ask me to blame myself, the list is just endless, so I will stop here ;)

### How were you before joining and how are you now
I was skeptical about moving into hostel for the first time, but I was totally fine since the day one. I never had any fixed goal, so there is nothing to change about it. Moving out, I think I am using my 'independence' individually and financially in a good manner. I am adjusting to things and adapting to the new environment pretty well. 

### What is your plan for the next 6 months? 
Get into some project and do something useful. Try to satisfy my dad's wish of minimum CGPA of 8.5

### How would you contribute back to the club?
