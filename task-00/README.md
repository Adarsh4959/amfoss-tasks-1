I had to skip this task since I had Ubuntu installed in my laptop for a while now ;)
Some of the distros I had tried before includes Arch Linux, Arco Linux, Manjaro (GNOME), Elementary OS, Fedora, Antergos. You would notice that most of these are based on arch since AUR was handy and it was a repo I couldn't live without!
My go to DE was always GNOME (No offence to KDE devs XD). No big reason, I love changing themes every now and then, that's why I prefer that. 
After using all these, I got accustomed to the terminal and I have been in love with it since then (Though I really need to practice git in terminal).
