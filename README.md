# Ashwin here!
Hello there. This is Ashwin, fresher at Amrita School of Engineering. I am from, born, brought up in Coimbatore. My answer to why I joined Amrita wouldn't be real fascinating as that was probably the only good option I had, since I was adamant about pursuing Computer science for my higher studies. The reason why I was so was because I think I have true passion for coding. I've been a noob Android developer since my 8th grade (I won't say I've crossed the noob mark yet). Apparently I know some Java and XML. I'm acquainted with Unity, After effects, Construct. Been fiddling with different Linux distros for a year now, so I kinda know some terminal commands. FOSS seems to be the ideal place to help myself out to have a better knowledge on things I like and make myself a better person as well.
