#Command Line app using GO
After installing go, I read the tour in golang's documentation until Methods and interfaces. I also read and did codes for file handling in go. Unfortunately I was not able to proceed with this task as I got my twitter API keys generated only two days before the deadline and I didn't find much time to learn about using twitter's API in Go.
